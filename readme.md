Project Name: Interactive Balance Sheet Dashboard
Created by: Anupa Jayakody

✨ Project Objective
To create a clean, interactive Tableau dashboard that allows users to visually explore a multi-year balance sheet, segmented by categories such as Assets, Liabilities, and Equity, and highlight structural changes over time.

🎯 Key Features & Highlights
✅ Highlight Formatting:
Applied color-based highlight formatting to:

Emphasize major components such as Cash, PPE, and Retained Earnings

Visually separate Current vs Non-Current sections

Draw attention to year-on-year changes with intuitive color cues

📅 Multi-Year Comparison:
Supports dynamic filtering by year, enabling quick comparison of how key line items evolved from 2022 to 2024

📚 Category Breakdown:
The dashboard is structured to group data under:

Current vs Non-Current Assets

Current vs Non-Current Liabilities

Equity Components, including Retained Earnings and Paid-in Capital

📈 Data-Driven Insights:

Strong year-over-year growth in Net PPE and Investments, indicating long-term capital investments

Gradual increase in Retained Earnings, consistent with upward Net Income trends

Proportionally higher Current Liabilities vs Long-Term Liabilities, which could signal short-term debt exposure

🔍 Data Insights Uncovered
Cash Reserves vs Debt: Despite increasing capital expenditures, cash and equivalents remain strong—signaling solid liquidity management.

Equity Strength: Majority of financing is via equity rather than long-term debt, suggesting a low-leverage structure.

Minority Interest is negative across all years, which could point to accumulated losses from minority-owned entities.
